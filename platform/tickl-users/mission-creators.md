# Mission Creators

Mission creators are the ones who create and distribute missions.&#x20;

Most commonly, they are app publishers and advertisers.&#x20;

Individual users also can be mission creators by using their **TCKL** tokens.

Mission creators can ask users to complete a specific action as a mission on the **TICKL** platform.

Actions can be app install, in-app action, website visit, video view, item purchase, etc.&#x20;

It can also be something light such as a "follow us on instagram" campaign or a simple Q\&A to get information in need quickly.&#x20;

Mission creators interact with users who participate in missions and help expand the **TICKL** platform together.
