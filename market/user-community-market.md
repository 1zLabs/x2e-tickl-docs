# User Community Market

**TICKL** provides a community platform based on missions for rewards that are created by users. Users create a variety of missions to engage other users to visit their social channels, answer their questions or take a quiz. Users have the flexibility to create and participate in missions, which forms a user community ecosystem.

Q\&A is a user community activity that best fit the **TICKL** platform. It’s an open system that rewards users to communicate with one another to build a collective knowledge database, which is a decentralized version of Quora or Naver Q\&A.

C2C market can be easily activated as well. Users can promote their services or products directly to other users. Small business owners who can’t run a large-scale marketing campaign can use a small amount of **TCKL** tokens to promote their products to a wider audience.
