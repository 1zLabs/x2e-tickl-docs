# Fraud Detection

Fraud detection is a process to filter out traffic or actions from fake accounts, virtual devices, and bots. Modeling is built by analyzing user behavior patterns, device settings, network or sensor settings, etc. Fraud detection technology is a key to **TICKL**'s business success. Engineers who developed the biggest reward ad system are building fraud detection technology to empower **TICKL** platform. **TICKL** continuosly updates new types of fraud and enhance the performance of its model.&#x20;

Also, all transactions are open and transparent, therefore inherently, itâ€™s very difficult to run fraudulent activities to get **TCKL** tokens. **TCKL** token redeem remains pending for up to 72 hours after a request. During this pending period, the fraud detection model analyzes the user's behavior and filters out fraud or abuse before proceeding with redeem.
