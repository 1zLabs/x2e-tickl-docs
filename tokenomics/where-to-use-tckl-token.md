# Where to Use TCKL Token

### Mission Management

**TCKL** is used to create, distribute and run mission campaigns.&#x20;

It takes a more number of tokens to run more complicated missions, such as more detailed targeting, wider audience size, etc.&#x20;

Tokens are rewarded to users when they complete mission tasks.&#x20;

### Benefits for Token Holders&#x20;

* **Loyalty Program:** Users have higher levels depending on how long they hold **TCKL** tokens and how many tokens they hold. Users with higher levels can participate in a more number of missions and earn higher rewards after completing mission tasks.&#x20;
* **Mission Creation:** Mission creators can create additional types of missions depending on how many tokens they hold.&#x20;
* **Mission Distribution:** Mission creators need to hold **TCKL** tokens at least 2x more than the size of rewards. For example, in order to distribute 100 **TCKL** worth of missions, a mission creator needs to possess a minimum of 200 **TCKL** in their account.

### Liquidity Pool

Users can swap TCKL tokens with other tokens on a blockchain network. A part of **TCKL** tokens is reserved in the liquidity pool to enable this swap.
