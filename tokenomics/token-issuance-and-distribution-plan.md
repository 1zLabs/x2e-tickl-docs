# Token Issuance and Distribution Plan

### Token Issuance

**TCKL** is mintable and burnable.&#x20;

The total volume of **TCKL** tokens cannot exceed 6 billion. Acquiring publishers and advertisers will be a key driver to cultivate the initial **TICKL** ecosystem.&#x20;

Some **TCKL** tokens are used to attract publishers and advertisers. Initial token issuance volume is set at 2 billion and more will be issued as the platform grows. Additional issuance volume will be under control to sustain **TCKL** token price.



### Token Distribution

**TICKL** project team members get **TCKL** tokens that are locked up for 2 years since the issue date. **TCKL** tokens are retrieved if a project team member drops off from **TICKL** project and may get reissued to the rest of the team members.&#x20;

A part of the tokens preserved on the company side can be used to fund the **TICKL** project through private sales. When a funding plan is determined, the information will be shared with the community and updated in the whitepaper.
