# How TICKL is Different

TICKL is different from other existing reward ad platforms.

| TICKL (on a blockchain)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | AdiSON, Adjoe, etc. (NOT on a blockchain)                                                                                                                                                                                                               |   |

| <p><strong>Global</strong></p><p>TCKL tokens work as a standard global currency to provide missions for rewards. Users can accrue rewards under a single account across multiple apps as all publishers on the TICKL platform use TCKL tokens as the same standard global currency. Users can easily swap or exchange TCKL tokens.</p> | <p><strong>Local</strong></p><p>It’s hard to become a global platform as it needs to serve different currencies. It’s hard for users to get significant rewards as publishers have their own reward systems. Redeem option is different by country.</p> |   |
| <p><strong>Transparent and Secure</strong></p><p>All <strong>TCKL</strong> transactions are transparent and open<strong>.</strong></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                 | <p><strong>Opaque and Insecure</strong></p><p>There are lots of customer inquiries due to a lack of transparency in how much user rewards are being given.</p>                                                                                          |   |
| <p><strong>Fair Distribution</strong></p><p>Mission creators can see how many <strong>TCKL</strong> tokens they are paying for mission campaigns and how many of them are given to users as rewards.</p>                                                                                                                               | <p><strong>Platform-dependent</strong></p><p>Hard to know how much revenue the platform made and how much was redistributed to users.</p>                                                                                                               |   |
