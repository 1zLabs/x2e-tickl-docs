# Users

Users are the ones who complete actions for a mission.

Users can easily find missions through publisher apps that are integrated into the **TICKL** platform.

Users can use various apps integrated on the platform and check different missions from each app.

Users can earn **TCKL** tokens as rewards for actions completed.

Users can use **TCKL** tokens to exchange with other tokens or to create a mission for their own campaigns.
