# Level System

Levels represent how much contribution a user has to the **TICKL** platform.

Users at a higher level can access more missions and earn more **TCKL** tokens for actions completed.

Users can obtain a higher level by completing more missions or by holding **TCKL** tokens for a longer term.

Levels can be downgraded when users withdraw or exchange **TCKL** tokens.
