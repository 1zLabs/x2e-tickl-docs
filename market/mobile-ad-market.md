### Major Problems in Mobile Ad Market

There are major problems in this fast-growing mobile ad market; (1) high ad commission fees and (2) fraud.

The commission fee of most programmatic ads is as high as 80% of the total ad spend because they run through DSP, SSP and Ad-Exchange. Due to this high commission fee, ad spend is often not spent to provide quality services to publishers or users.

Fraud is another big issue. Ad fraud is the practice of fraudulently representing traffic, clicks, impressions, conversions, or data events. Ad fraud is estimated to account for around 50% of total mobile ads.&#x20;

These 2 issues occur due to a lack of transparency in the current mobile ad ecosystem. Big ad tech companies such as Google and Facebook don’t publicly open how and from where they make ad revenue and how they distribute it. Bringing transparency to the ad industry will help solve these 2 major problems.
